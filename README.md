# Calibration Tricycle-like Robot

## Overview

This project focuses on the calibration of a tricycle-like robot, aiming to improve its accuracy and performance through precise adjustments and measurements. The calibration process involves a least-square engine to fine-tune the robot's parameters. Given a false trajectory (obtained by the odometry), and a reference trajectory (obtained by external sensors), we could adjust the kinematic parameters for minimize the distance between this 2 trajectory
